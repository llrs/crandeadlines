The goal of crandeadlines is to retrieve the CRAN deadlines of packages, to find each deadline is, and to 
make a [dashboard](https://llrs.github.io/crandeadlines/articles/dashboard.html).

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("llrs/crandeadlines")
```

## Example

This is a basic example :

``` r
cran_outgoing <- crandeadlines::take_snapshot()
```

The vignette produces a [handy dashboard](https://llrs.github.io/crandeadlines/articles/dashboard.html) that we update every hour via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/llrs/crandeadlines/actions).

## Historical data

Hourly snapshots of the ftp server are saved in the [`history` branch](https://github.com/llrs/crandeadlines/tree/history), as part of our [rendering workflow](https://github.com/llrs/crandeadlines/blob/c54ec4bf7c05e9c91510176dd933d103b59a6779/.github/workflows/render-dashboard.yml#L48-L67). 
A short script to load this historical data as a `data.frame` is also provided in the package:

``` r
historical_data <- crandeadlines::download_history()
```
